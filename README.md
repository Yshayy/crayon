Crayon
======

(readme.md update in progress, 2013-07-25).  

* Crayon is a complete monitoring and charting solution for large scale applications. 
* Crayon is an open source contributed by [Taboola][] and will remain free forever.
* Crayon is a stack which consists of [NodeJS][] as server, [MongoDB][] as storage and [dyGraphs][] as charting control. 
* Crayon is a smooth migration from old school monitoring systems such as [Munin][] (and soon [Graphite][])
* Crayon is unique in many ways. Some of its features are unavailable in most of today's modern monitoring systems.
